# Spam Bot
This is a simple python bot to demonstrate how PyAutoGUI works.

You have to make sure that you have python installed.
If not, install it from https://www.python.org/downloads/

For this to work, you need to have a python package named 'PyAutoGUI'

You can run the command 'pip install PyAutoGUI'
Or else if you're lazy to do that, run the python file named 'install-PyAutoGUI'

BUT FOR THIS LAZY SCRIPT TO WORK FIRST INSTALL PYTHON.


How does this work?
 - make sure that you place your cursor in a place where text can be typed.
 - basically, after running the script, place your cursor within 5 seconds.
 - I have attached a text file called 'bee' which is simply a demo.
 
 
 
 Thanks for reading.
 HAPPY SPAMMING ;)

# This is a simple python bot to demonstrate how PyAutoGUI works.

You have to make sure that you have python installed.
If not, install it from https://www.python.org/downloads/

For this to work, you need to have a python package named 'PyAutoGUI'

You can run the command 'pip install PyAutoGUI'
Or else if you're lazy to do that, run the python file named 'install-PyAutoGUI.py'
BUT FOR THIS LAZY SCRIPT TO WORK FIRST INSTALL PYTHON.

# = OPTIONAL =
I would recommend you to use a good text editor such as Sublime Text 3
if you want to modify my code or write some code if you were following my "upcoming"
YT video. Chech out my channel @ https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKHKr6D1OgItleeWR-2nLiQ
Download sublime from https://www.sublimetext.com/
# = OPTIONAL STUFF OVER =

Above given thing is not so important you can literally use any text editor
BUT NOT 'MS WORD'. Notepad will be more than enough but make sure to have 4
spaces as indentation in NOTEPAD (I have warned u in my video).

# How does this work?
 - Make sure that you place your cursor in a place where text can be typed.
   I chose whatsapp as an example (You may use anything i.e. Instagram, Telegram etc.)
 - Basically, after running the script, place your cursor in the typing area
   within 5 seconds (You can change it to 10 in my script if you think you need more time).
 - I have attached a text file called 'bee' which is simply a demo.

 Thanks for reading. It means a lot to me.
#HAPPY SPAMMING ;)

This is a simple python bot to demonstrate how PyAutoGUI works.

You have to make sure that you have python installed.
If not, install it from https://www.python.org/downloads/

For this to work, you need to have a python package named 'PyAutoGUI'

You can run the command 'pip install PyAutoGUI'
Or else if you're lazy to do that, run the python file named 'install-PyAutoGUI'

BUT FOR THIS LAZY SCRIPT TO WORK FIRST INSTALL PYTHON.
